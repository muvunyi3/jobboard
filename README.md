Configuration
Database: By default, the project is configured to use SQLite. However, you can easily switch to other databases supported by Django, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, by updating the DATABASES setting in settings.py.
Email: Configure email settings in settings.py to enable email notifications. Update EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, and other relevant settings according to your email service provider.
Static Files: Static files are served from the static directory by default. For production, you may want to configure a separate static file server or use a content delivery network (CDN).
Security: Ensure proper security measures are implemented before deploying the application to a production environment. This includes setting DEBUG to False, configuring HTTPS, and implementing user authentication best practices.
